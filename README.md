PCB design files, gerbers, BOM and the STLs for the enclosure (designed by [@eplop](https://twitter.com/eplop)) are included in this repo.

If you've received one of these boards: add desired quantites of [C42428](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Connectors_Jing-Extension-of-the-Electronic-Co-912-121A2023S10100_C42428.html) , [C165948](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Connectors_Korean-Hroparts-Elec-TYPE-C-31-M-12_C165948.html) and [C23186](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Chip-Resistor-Surface-Mount_UNI-ROYAL-Uniroyal-Elec-0603WAF5101T5E_C23186.html) to your next LCSC order and print the STLs in a colour of your choice, few minutes of soldering and some creative geometries with double sided tape and you have your usb-elbow ready to install!

Please note that while hiding your USB RF stick is a good idea for cosmetics and decor, it might actually degrade the RF performance depending on what is nearby. Dried lavender stalks, great. Metal statuette or photo frames, not so much. Before affixing your usb-elbow semi-permanently with strong double-sided tape, it might be a good idea to use some masking tape/low-tack adhesive to do a trial run to see how things are.
